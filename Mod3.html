    <h1>The Princess Who Chose to be Herself</h1>
    <p>Once upon a <span id = "time"> _________ </span>, in a faraway kingdom, there was a beautiful princess named Lily. Lily had everything she could ever want: riches, jewels, and a grand palace to call home. However, deep down inside, Lily felt like something was missing. She felt like she couldn't be her true self because of the expectations placed upon her by the kingdom.</p>
    <p>Lily was expected to act like a perfect princess, to be elegant and poised at all times. But what Lily really wanted was to run wild through the fields and climb trees. She wanted to wear comfortable clothes instead of tight, restrictive gowns. Lily longed to be free to be herself, but she knew that if she did, she would disappoint her parents and the kingdom's people.</p>
    <p>One night, as she lay in her luxurious bed, Lily made a decision. She was tired of pretending to be someone she wasn't. She decided that she would be true to herself, no matter what anyone else thought. The next morning, she put on a pair of breeches and a simple shirt and went for a walk in the woods.</p>
    <p>When the people of the kingdom saw her, they were shocked. They had never seen their <span id = "princess"> _________</span> dressed like a commoner before. They whispered and pointed, and soon the rumors began to spread. The king and queen were furious with Lily. They scolded her and demanded that she start acting like a proper princess again. But Lily refused.</p>
    <p>She continued to dress as she pleased and do the things she enjoyed. As a result, the people of the kingdom began to distance themselves from her. Lily felt lonely at first, but she knew that she had made the right decision. She was finally able to be her true self, and that was all that mattered.</p>
    <p>One day, a young girl approached Lily in the woods. She was amazed by the princess's <span id = "bravery"> _________</span> in being herself, and she wanted to be just like her. Lily realized then that her actions had inspired others to be true to themselves as well. Even though she had lost the support of her kingdom, she had gained something far more valuable - the knowledge that she was being true to herself and inspiring others</p>
    <p>From that day on, <span id = "Lily"> _________</span> continued to live her life as she pleased. She found joy in the simple things and made new friends who loved her for who she was, not for the title she held. She was happy and at peace, knowing that she was finally living an authentic life. And even though the people of the kingdom never fully accepted her for who she was, she was content in the knowledge that she was true to herself, and that was all that mattered.</p>
